# Welcome to the ChargeXL!

An XLL & Excel-DNA based add-in for MS Excel which is open for further development and enhancement in the community as well as available to download for MS Excel (2007,2010,2013, and 2016) users. It might cost me and other community developers the huge amount of time but it's free to use for everyone. 

***

### Set-Up (Developers)
1. This XLL add-in depends upon Excel-DNA (64 bit). So, please go through their documentation on setting up the environment (32bit or 64bit). Otherwise, Excel will claim that the file (_ChargeXL.xll_) is in an incorrect format.
2. Clone the git repository and open the file _ChargeXL.sln_ in Visual Studio.
3. In the project properties for the library, configure the debugging start action as follows: (‘Office16’ is the directory for Office 2016, substitute ‘Office15’ for Office 2013, 'Office14' for Office 2010, 'Office12' for Office 2007 or another version as appropriate.)


### Set-Up (Users)
